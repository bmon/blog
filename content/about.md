Hi, I'm Brendan. I'm an Australian software engineer with a background in
web development. I listen to loads of music, play videogames with friends, and
back the [Swans](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=sydney+swans). At other times
you might find me playing tennis, jamming on a personal project, or fixing my
Arch (btw) install.

Hopefully you'll find this blog filled with interesting posts about linux, web
stack tech, and maybe even the occasional netsec post. If you would like to chat,
[tweet](https://twitter.com/__bmon__) at me or shoot me an
[email](mailto:br3ndanr@gmail.com).
